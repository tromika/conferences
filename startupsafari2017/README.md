Notebooks are a new way for data exploration, visualization and sharing insights. In a single environment, you can you use many languages like R, Python or SQL etc. for exploring the data while you can collaborate real-time with your colleagues. In R Shiny you can create dashboards while leveraging R powerful statistical capabilities. For special need, there is a javascript data visualization library I promise.
