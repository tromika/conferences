Apache Spark is a buzzing tool in the analytics world but you need the right platform to utilize its power. Docker with Mesos could be a great choice as the base of your analytics system that runs Spark. With this, you can follow the rapidly changing landscape and growing toolset. In a modern analytics platform, we have to deal with batch, interactive and streaming workload and this could be a challenge. The presentation outlines the technical aspects of our journey with Docker, Mesos and Spark. Our challenge was to support heterogeneous workload and running Spark alongside other applications.
